Information About the Post
<%= render partial: "authors/author", locals: {post_author: @author}
<%= @post.title %>
<%= @post.content %>
<!--
-We are no longer passing the render method a String; we're passing key-value pairs
-The first key-value pair tells Rails the name of the partial to render ("authors/author")
-The second key-value pair specifies the locals as a Hash. That Hash's keys (post_author here)
 will be created as local variables within the partial.
