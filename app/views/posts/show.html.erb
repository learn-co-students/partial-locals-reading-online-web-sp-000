Information About the Post
<%= render partial: "authors/author", locals: {post_author: @post.author} %>
<%= @post.title %>
<%= @post.content %>

<!-- local varaibles make our code more explicit
no longer passing the render method
key value pair render authors/author
second key value pair specifies locals as a hash keys=post_author

partials dry out our views
locals hash can be used to create flexibility in our calls to the partials
